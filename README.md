It's a simple navigation menu with a hamburger icon that can be toggled ON and OFF by clicking on it.
when the hamburger icon is clicked , it adds or removes the "active" class to both the "hamburger" and "navMenu" elements.
the "active" class is commonly used in CSS to apply specific styles to elements, and in this case ,it is likely used to show or hide the navigation menu when the hamburger icon is clicked.

And the last part of the code allows the user to toggle the visibility of the navigation menu by clicking on a hamburger icon, and it also ensures that clicking on any navigation link within the menu will close it. The "active" class is used to control the visibility of the menu through CSS styles.
